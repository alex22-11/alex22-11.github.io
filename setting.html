		<h2>Setting up the tank</h2>

		<H3>Preparing hardscape</H3>

		<p>Now that you have all your supplies, it is time to prepare the hardscape. You would generally want sand on the background to be higher than on the foreground to add a sense of depth to you aquarium.</p>

		<div class="planting">
			<h3>Planting plants </h3>
			<p> You would usually get plants either in an "in vitro cup" or planted in glasswool in a pot. In both cases, you would have to remove either the gel from in vitro, or the glasswool from the roots of the plant. You also have to separate the plant into multiple sections to ensure the roots have enough space to grow and the plant can propagate sideways. </p>

			<p> You should then go to your next door neighbour and ask for a pair of bent tweezers. </p>

			<p> Now you need to fill the tank with just enough water to cover the substrate. This will make planting significantly easier. </p>

			<p> You now have to grab the plant at the root with the tweezers and press the plant into the gravel, until it's exactly where you want it to be. Let go carefully, and pull the tweezers away while shaking the tweezers to allow gravel to bury the roots. </p>
			<p> Once you are satisfied with planting, you can start installing the filter and heater by following the instructions on the box. Then you can fully fill your tank. </p>
		</div>

		<h3>Fertilising</h3>
		<p>
			It is essential to start fertilising the water immediately after planting. Follow the dosage stated on the fertiliser.
