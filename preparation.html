				<h2>Important!!!</h2>
				<p>
					I mentioned in the previous page that you can decorate your aquarium to your taste. This is however only partially true. <br> You need to ensure that all the elements inside your tank are suitable for each other.
					<br><br> 
					A big mistake I made was that I got relatively coarse gravel as substrate. This was fine in the beggining, but I later decided to grow <a href="https://www.aquasabi.com/Eleocharis-sp-Mini" target="_blank">"Dwarf Hair Grass"</a> which preffered a finer substrate. 
					<br> <br> 
					I also combined <a href="https://www.aquasabi.com/Eleocharis-sp-Mini" target="_blank">"Dwarf Hair Grass"</a> with <a href="https://www.aquasabi.com/Microsorum-pteropus" target="_blank">the Java Fern</a>, which have two completely opposite requirements. One requires extremely high light intensity, high CO2 and high nutrients, while the other requires the total opposite. Up till today, I still have to choose between having a nice green carpet, but with algae covered java fern, or a sad yellow carpet with a healthy java fern. 


				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="substrate">
				<h3>Substrates</h3>
				<p>
					There are generally two types of substrates. Those that contain nutrients for plants, and those that are purely just gravel or sand. Most plants would be fine obtaining nutrients only from the water column so you wouldn't have to get <strong>expensive</strong> nutrient rich substrate, but do research on your plants beforehand. It is also reccomended to get a substrate that is not too coarse (gravel), but also not too fine (soil).
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="filtration">
				<h3>Filtration</h3>
				<p>
					It is reccomended to get a filter that has a filtration rate (litres per hour) of at least 10x the size of your tank in litres. I would personally recommend <strong>hang on filters</strong> as they also act as a surface skimmer. The most important part is ensuring that your filter has a "biological medium" for bacteria to grow on, and does not contain any form of activated carbon since this will remove all forms of nutrients needed by the plants.
					<br><br>
					Many filters can also house heating elements, to prevent an ugly sight in the aquarium. Ask your local fish store for more advice on this.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="plants">
				<h3>Plants</h3>
				<p>
					It is up to you to decide which plants you would like to have. You only need to ensure that both the plants and the shrimps you will get will have similar temperature requirements. You also have to make sure that you buy plants in accordance with your lighting and CO2 content of your tank.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Advice</h2>
			<p>
				You will quickly realise that the prices of substrate, filtration and plants alone add up very quickly. And you still need to purchase many other elements. You can cheap out on as much as you like from the entire setup, but the two <font size="+1.5"><strong>essential</strong></font> things are <font size="+1.5"><strong>filtration and plants</strong></font>. 
				<br><br>
				Cheaping out on filtration will cause a lot of water parameters problems in the future, and the lack of plants will cause a big algae bloom in the beggining. It is always better to overplant a tank, rather than underplant, since any surplus of nutrients in the water will be easily consumed by algae. 
			</p>



				<p>
					<h3>Water test kits</h3>
				<p>
					There are mainly two ways to conduct water tests. There are the so called test strips, as well as test drops. 
				</p>
					<span id="dots">...</span>
					<span id="more">
					As the name implies, test strips are a strip with multiple tests. All you have to do is dip the strip in the aquarium, wait a minute, and you should see the results immediately.
				</p>
				<p>
				<div class="row">

					<div class="column">

						<h3>Benefits of test strips:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Cheaper to purchase</li>
							<li>Easier to use</li>
							<li>Faster results</li>
							<li>Can test multiple parameters</li>
						</ul> 

					</div>

				</div>

				<p>With test drops, you would have to individually buy all the tests for every different parameter you are testing. Not only is it expensive, but it is also very time consuming and takes up a lot of space. The benefit is that it is significantly more accurate than the test strips. Afterall, why bother testing your water if the results are going to be extremely inaccurate?
				<br><br>
				The good news is your local fish store has a "drop test kit" available. Meaning you do not have to individually buy all the pieces. Click on the image below to see more details.</p>
